# basic_finance
Very basic finance managing program, taking in users input and storing them on an SQLLite DB.

Program will ask user to input the name a payment is due to come out, the date it is to come out and how much for. Any incoming cash should be input as -# due to the way I am calculating this although I hope to provide additional features to cover this in future.

This is just a small personal project I am working on as I use various tools to manage my own finances and something that can easily show upcoming payments is useful for me, however while I currently do this in Excel I wanted to try convert this into Python due to my studies.
